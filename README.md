## Hyprland
A flashy window manager used for general browsing. In use in preview photo. Some custom keybinds added customized to my liking.

## i3
A minimalist window manager used for my dev workflow. Keybinds added just like Hyprland.

## Alacritty
Terminal emulator used. Some transparency added.

## Neovim
My main IDE for all things programming. NVChad as the base with some custom configurations.

## Helix
My secondary IDE used for any small projects. Once Helix adds support for snippets (React, tailwind, html, etc) and maybe plugins, I will revisit the idea of this being my main IDE.

## Tmux
My terminal multiplexer, for opening different panes and managing multiple workspaces. Combined with neovim through a plugin to navigate smoothly.

## Rofi
A cool Rofi menu I found on github, to quickly launch applications.

## Swaylock
Combined with Hypr to provide a lockscreen after inactivity, with the monitor sleeping after a certain time period.

## Waybar
Bar used in preview.
